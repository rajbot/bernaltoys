Lasercut Hindi Letters
======================

Great for teaching kids Hindi!


Inkscape and Lasersaur Notes
----------------------------
These shape files are designed to be cut on a 12" x 12" sheet of plywood. I use 1/8" think birch.

These SVG files were made in Inkscape using the Mac OSX Devanagari font "Devanagari Sangam MT".
Although Inkscape is an X11 app and doesn't let you input Devanagari directly using the OSX
Text Input Sources, I was able to write the words I wanted in TextEdit and then copy/paste
them into Inkscape.

I set font size to 288 in Inkscape. Then I do the following:
- Select text object
- Path > Object to Path
- Path > Break Apart
- Path > Outset (to make the font weight bolder)
- Remove fill and add stroke to the paths
- Select each letter place it to minimize waste
- Either hand-place each letter, or overlap them and choose Object > Align and Distribute
- Use Align and Distribute > Remove overlaps with a setting of 5px
- You might want to leave more space between letters if used as a puzzle

For Lasersaur settings, I use 600mm/min at 96% power with 1/8" birch.
